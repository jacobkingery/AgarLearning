Good:
can basically call a function in python from node
python process can be running side-by-side

Bad:
have to run python process side-by-side (maybe could spawn it from in node?)
non-blocking (this is probably a good thing in the long run, but initially we may need to work around it)
needs node version >=0.12.7 (I had to upgrade)
