# Agar Learning: Investigating Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning by Building an Agar.io Bot


**Sophia, Mac-I, and Jacob**

## Project Overview
This project, we are planning to learn about genetic algorithms, neural networks, and reinforcement learning. To do this, we plan to create a bot that will play the game [“Agar”](agar.io). We are hoping to use this bot as a vehicle for learning about the topics described above, rather than having the main goal of the project to be to create best bot possible. 

To this effect, we have found a node.js implementation of “Agar”, called [“Ogar”](https://github.com/OgarProject/Ogar), that we will use as the base for our project. On top of this implementation, we plan to write code that allows bots to learn how to play this game. 

Our MVP is to create a bot that survives on a game board, where it is the only “intelligent”, or moving piece on the board. Our stretch goals include implementing reinforcement learning algorithms that allow a bot to play against other bots that are also learning, and/or other, human players. Basically, as our project carries on, we want to build reinforcement algorithms that require the environment to be less and less constrained. 

Additionally, we are also planning on creating tools that allow us to play back games, and visualize performance of our bots, with the goal of creating a website that allows others to learn about what we learned about neural networks/genetic algorithms/reinforcement learning in a fun context. 

## Dataset

We do not have a dataset that we are working on. Since we are intending to use reinforcement learning, we will be generating our data as we go. The obstacles we foresee are related to handling the reinforcement learning rather than obtaining a dataset.


## New Skills and Techniques

We will need to learn about topics related to reinforcement learning, neural networks (potentially material for an in-class discussion if multiple groups are interested), and genetic algorithms. We also will need to learn about how to interface between python and javascript or how to do machine learning in javascript. We will also need to visualize what our bot is “thinking”, because we will not be able to understand what is happening very easily with the current Ogar setup. 


## Project Timeline

Here is what we hope done at the end of each week
* Week 1: 
	* Set up control structure for controlling bots (potentially interfacing with python)
	* Figure out how we are going to configure Ogar
	* Find resources on Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning
* Week 2:
	* Blog entry on how we are setting up our environment
	* Implement some (as simple as possible) learning algorithm with Ogar
* Week 3:
	* Iterate!
	* Visualize bot performance
* Week 4:
	* Optimize model
	* Code freeze (stop working on bot and ML tasks)
* Week 5:
	* Finalize documentation
	* Prepare presentation


## Challenges and Risks

There a few large risks for our project. One risk is that we we have to spend significant amounts of time getting our “environment” setup. We will need to interface with Ogar in a way that allows us to both control the server, set game state, other players, simulation speed, as well as control a player within the game, Another, risk is that none of us have experience in this area and so 

## This Project and Our Learning Goals

**Sophia:**
-----------
I think that this project fits in very well with my learning goals. I will have plenty of opportunities to try new tools/techniques in the project. Additionally, in the website that we make as a final deliverable for this project, there is plenty of potential to tell a coherent (and compelling, or at least, fun) story about what we learned by trying to make a bot using reinforcement learning. The one place that our project might not fit as clearly with my learning goal is with the scoping of the project. I’m aware that this project has the potential to never really be “done”, and as a result will take up as much time as I let it. To deal with this, we are planning on having a code freeze in the second to last week of the project, and shifting our focus to documenting and writing up the project, no matter where we are in the process of creating a bot. Additionally, since our goal is to learn about machine learning concepts, rather than to create a great bot, learning about these concepts will happen before we create a bot. This means that the part of the project that is pivotal to our goal happens earlier, rather than later, which means that failure to implement an advanced bot is not necessarily project failure. 

**Mac-I:**
My learning goals align quite nicely with this project. This project will allow me to improve my ability to estimate the length of time a task will take through practice. It will allow me to learn about a new algorithm. Lastly this project should allow me to focus on learning rather than producing deliverables since the goal of the project is not to present something that will change the world. 

**Jacob:**
My learning goals align quite well with this project. Learning about a new machine learning model is a good fit because this will be pretty necessary for the project to succeed. This project is very model-focused which works well with my goal of doing mostly model-related things. We are all interested in managing time well, so having our project be learning-oriented rather than results-oriented lends itself well to being adjusted along the way.
